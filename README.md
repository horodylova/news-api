Setup Instructions

To set up the project, you need to create two environment configuration files: .env.test and .env.development. These files should be placed in the root directory of the project.

Create .env.test: PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

Create .env.development: PGDATABASE=nc_news

These environment variables are used to configure the PostgreSQL database connections.
